Create a phone book. You must also create a menu with three choices "1:Add Contact", "2:Get Contact", "3:Exit". When the user press 1, the system asks the user to give a name and a number. Then the system stores this information to a contact and after this, to the phone book. When the user press 2, the system asks the user to give the name that he searches for. Then, the system searches for the contact into the phonebook and returns the number. Pressing 3, the system must close.
