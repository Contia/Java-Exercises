# Exercise

Write a program called ComputePI to compute the value of π, using the following series expansion. You have to decide on the termination criterion used in the computation (such as the number of terms used or the magnitude of an additional term). Is this series suitable for computing π?

π = 4 * ( 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + 1/13 - 1/15 ...)
