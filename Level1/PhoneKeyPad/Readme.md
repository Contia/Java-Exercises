# Exercise

On your phone keypad, the alphabets are mapped to digits as follows: ABC(2), DEF(3), GHI(4), JKL(5), MNO(6), PQRS(7), TUV(8), WXYZ(9). Write a program called PhoneKeyPad, which prompts user for a String (case insensitive), and converts to a sequence of keypad digits. Use a nested-if (or switch-case) in this exercise.
