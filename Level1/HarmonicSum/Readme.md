# Exercise

Write a program called HarmonicSum to compute the sum of a harmonic series, as shown below, where n=50000. The program shall compute the sum from left-to-right as well as from the right-to-left. Obtain the difference between these two sums and explain the difference. Which sum is more accurate?

Harmonic(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ...
